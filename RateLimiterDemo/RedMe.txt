Why It’s Fixed Window
- Window defined: Requests are counted in a fixed time slice (e.g., 10 seconds).
- Counter reset: At the end of the window, the counter resets to zero.
- Behavior:
- First 5 requests in the window → allowed.
- 6th request (within the same 10s) →  rejected (HTTP 429).
- At 10s mark → counter resets, new requests allowed again.

 Characteristics
- Simple & fast to implement.
- Edge burst problem: If a client sends 5 requests at the end of one window and 5 at the start of the next, they effectively send 10 requests almost instantly.
- Best for: APIs where simplicity matters more than perfectly smooth traffic.

 Alternatives in .NET Core
ASP.NET Core’s Rate Limiting middleware also supports:
- Sliding Window → smoother distribution, avoids burstiness.
- Token Bucket → allows bursts but enforces average rate.
- Concurrency Limiter → limits simultaneous requests instead of time‑based.
